<h1>Main Ideas</h1>
<b>The Internet</b>
<p>Ther internet is a computer network, allowing computers all around the world to communicate with eachother.  Many of the communciations on the internet contain the infomration required to display web pages on a computer.  The communication for a web page is kicked off when a person opens a browser and types the destination <em><b>URL</b></em> into the browser window.  The browser uses the address to send a request to a server.  The browser works with the computer and other servers to convert the URL to the server address.  The server will respond with the information requested in <b>HTML</b> format.</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<p><em><b>HTML</b></em> stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is the code that is read by the browser to tell the computer what to display.  The code contains the elements that make up the webpage.  The basic tags add stylistic elements to the page, but tags are also used to add images, or links.</p>
<b>ELEMENTS</b>
<p>Elements are either inline or block.  Block elements create a separation from other elements by creating an <em>"invisible"</em>box around them.</p>
